# Sea Shanty - Semantic HTML Teaching Tool

Ahoy! This Node.js app serves a tutorial-style HTML page styled like a sea shanty, walking users through the basics of semantic HTML. From `<header>`s to `<form>`s, and `<ul>`s to `<table>`s, this project wraps web structure lessons in a lighthearted theme.
